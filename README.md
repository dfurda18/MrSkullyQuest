# MrSkullyQuest
Plunge yourself into the world of the undead and give a hand to our protagonist who’s just dying to meet you.  

In Mr. Skully’s Quest is a 3D runner game where you take control of this spineless skeleton and roll jump and bite your way through the pits of the afterlife to upgrade yourself and gear up to come back to the glorious land of the living. 

## Plot
Mr. Skully was formerly known as a wizard named Reginald Skully the Fourth, born in the Dark Ages. He was Merlin’s apprentice, one of the brightest of all. But, he was stubborn, arrogant and thought that he knew everything and was ready to leave the apprenticeship, differently as his master thought about it. 

Transgressing Merlin, He went exploring and finds a scroll. This was a scroll of “immortality”. 

Upon finding the scroll, he does not read it carefully and ends up invoking immorality on it. 

Wanting to abort the spell immediately, he creates secondary effects that make his form change, causing his body to die and all that remained were his bones. 

As a punishment, Merlin says that he needs to deal alone with a way to turn back to normal and expel him and he is not Merlin’s apprentice anymore.

Mr. Skully must get a magic item to get new skin and avoid scaring people – the hat of disguise – while he researches and look for a way to dispel and recover his lost magical bones parts. 

## Mechanics
Mr. Skully’s Quest is an auto-running platformer about a clumsy wizard who lost everything but his bones when making an immortality spell. The game consists of randomly generated levels with specific objectives to complete.
